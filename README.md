# Examer ðŸ“– 
[![Project Status: Abandoned â€“  Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)![Android CI workflow](https://github.com/t3chkid/Examer/actions/workflows/Android-CI.yaml/badge.svg)

Examer is an Android app that is used to take tests that evaluate a person's ability to listen to, and understand conversations in English.
To try out this app you need to use the latest version of [Android Studio Arctic Fox](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=EAIaIQobChMInc7OlbDD9QIVmpJmAh2lKgaZEAAYASAAEgLvsfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

## Note
Although the app works, the development of this project has been permanently stopped. There is no intention of continuing the development of this project. The features implemented will work, but bugs are bound to exist. The app doesn't handle most of the exceptions, especially those related to network. FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) is used in the app, but, the token is just logged and not stored anywhere.
